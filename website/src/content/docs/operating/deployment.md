How to run the CTXone Hub, and the configuration choices that matter — the
**shared daemon** (the standard setup), running it **as a service**, giving an
agent its **own memory**, and **securing** the hub with a token when you expose
it beyond localhost. If you followed the Quickstart and everything works, you
already have the standard setup; this page is the reference for the rest.

## The one rule that governs every setup

**One hub owns one db file at a time.** On startup a hub writes a PID lockfile
next to the db (`<db>.lock`). If a second hub tries to open the same `--path`
while the first is alive, it **refuses to start**:

```
database is already locked by ctxone-hub pid 12345 (lockfile: …/memory.db.lock);
refusing to start a second hub against the same db
```

This is deliberate — two hubs writing one SQLite file corrupts it (the
2026-04-28 incident). See [DATA_SAFETY.md](/operating/data-safety/). Everything below is
really about *who* holds that single lock.

## How a hub can run

`ctxone-hub` has two transports for talking to agents, plus the HTTP surfaces:

| Mode | Command | Serves | Owns the db |
|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **MCP stdio** | `ctxone-hub --path DB` | MCP tools to the spawning agent | yes, while the agent runs |
| **HTTP (+Lens)** | `ctxone-hub --http --lens --path DB` | REST API + web UI + **MCP at `/mcp`** | yes, while the daemon runs |

**The standard setup is one shared HTTP daemon.** An `--http` hub serves MCP (at
`/mcp`, Streamable HTTP) + REST + the Lens web UI from one process, and
`ctx init` (default `--transport http`) points every tool at it by URL — no
lockfile race, web UI always up, all tools share one graph. `ctx init
--transport stdio` is the escape hatch: each tool spawns its own hub that holds
the lock, so you can't also run a web UI on that db. Design notes:
the unified-hub design.

## Choosing a topology

Most setups want **Topology B (the shared daemon)** — it's what `ctx init` writes
by default. Topology A is the no-daemon fallback; C and D cover isolation and
one-off inspection.

### A. Agent-only stdio (no daemon, fallback)

`ctx init --transport stdio` — each tool spawns and owns its own stdio hub.
Nothing else touches the db.

- ✅ Zero extra processes, no port, no daemon to run.
- ❌ No Lens; can't attach the CLI-over-HTTP to *this* db while the agent runs
  (the CLI reads the same graph, but only through a running HTTP hub). One tool
  per db — a second tool needs its own db (topology C).

### B. Shared HTTP daemon — the default & standard

Run **one** long-lived hub that serves everything, and point agents, the CLI, and
Lens at it. Nothing spawns its own child; there is exactly one db owner. This is
what a plain `ctx init` configures.

```bash
# 1. Run the one daemon (ideally as a login service — see below — so it's up at boot).
ctxone-hub --http --lens --path ~/.ctxone/memory.db

# 2. Point the CLI at it (defaults to http://localhost:3001, so usually optional).
export CTX_SERVER=http://localhost:3001

# 3. Configure your tools to connect by URL. http is the default, so plain:
ctx init                       # all detected tools
ctx init --tool claude         # or one tool
```

`ctx init` (default `--transport http`) writes an MCP entry like:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ctxone": { "type": "http", "url": "http://localhost:3001/mcp?namespace=<detected>" }
  }
}
```

The `?namespace=` is filled in from the project detected in the current directory
(same scoping a per-project stdio hub would use). Override the endpoint with
`--mcp-url`, e.g. `--mcp-url http://mybox:3001/mcp`.

- ✅ One process, one lock, **startup order irrelevant** — the reboot race is gone.
  Lens always up, independent of any agent; multiple agents share one graph.
- MCP clients reach the daemon two ways, and `ctx init --transport http` writes
  the right one per client:
  - **Native URL** — Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code get `{"type":"http","url":…}`.
  - **`mcp-remote` bridge** — **Claude Desktop** has no native HTTP MCP support,
    so `ctx init` writes an stdio bridge
    (`npx -y mcp-remote <url> --transport http-only`) that proxies to the daemon.
    Requires Node/npx on PATH; a note is printed when this is used.
  - **Codex** — native HTTP via a `url` key in `config.toml`
    (`[mcp_servers.ctxone]\nurl = "…/mcp?namespace=…"`).
- ⚠️ A single daemon has no per-cwd project detection, so **one agent config maps
  to one namespace** (baked into the URL). An agent that roams many repos uses one
  fixed namespace or per-workspace configs. Need per-cwd auto-scoping? Use stdio
  (topology A) — it's still fully supported.

### C. Give an agent its own dedicated db (isolation)

Point one agent at a **different `--path`** so it never contends with your shared
hub or another agent. Two separate files → two separate locks → no conflict, and
two independent memory graphs.

Edit that agent's MCP config (or run `ctx init --tool <name>` after setting the
path). The stdio entry looks like:

```jsonc
// e.g. ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ctxone": {
      "command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/ctxone-hub",
      "args": ["--path", "/Users/you/.ctxone/claude.db", "--agent-id", "claude-desktop"]
    }
  }
}
```

Use this when:

- You want Claude's memory kept **separate** from a shared/team graph.
- Two agents on one machine should **not** see each other's memory.
- You're experimenting and don't want to touch your main graph.

> Isolated dbs do **not** sync. A fact remembered in `claude.db` is invisible to
> the hub serving `memory.db`. To browse an isolated db in Lens, run a hub on it
> at a **different port** while the agent is stopped, or on a copy:
> `ctxone-hub --http --lens --path /Users/you/.ctxone/claude.db --port 3002`.

### D. Browse a live agent's memory without fighting the lock

You can't open a second hub on a locked db. To look at the graph an agent is
actively using, snapshot it and serve the copy:

```bash
cp ~/.ctxone/memory.db /tmp/lens.db
ctxone-hub --http --lens --path /tmp/lens.db --port 3002
```

Read-only snapshot; it won't reflect writes after the copy. (The proper fix is
the shared daemon in topology B — one owner, Lens live on the same graph the
agents write.)

## Configuration reference

### Where the db lives

`ctx init` points agents at the canonical path:

- macOS / Linux: `~/.ctxone/memory.db`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\ctxone\memory.db`

Override per agent with `--path` (topology C). A bare `ctxone-hub` with no
`--path` defaults to `./target/ctxone.db` (dev convenience) — always pass
`--path` in real setups.

### Useful flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--path <PATH>` | SQLite db file (per-agent isolation lives here) |
| `--http` | Enable the REST API |
| `--lens` | Serve the web UI at `/` (requires `--http`) |
| `--port <N>` | HTTP port (default 3001) — use distinct ports for parallel dbs |
| `--agent-id <NAME>` | Attribution recorded on commits (`ctx blame`) |
| `--auth-token <TOK>` | Bearer token guarding REST + `/mcp` (env `CTXONE_AUTH_TOKEN`); loopback exempt |
| `--allowed-origin <ORIGIN>` | Extra browser origin allowed to call the API (repeatable; same-origin is always allowed) |
| `--init` | Create the db file if missing (guards against path typos) |
| `--storage memory` | Ephemeral, no file, no lock — good for tests/demos |
| `--asd-path name=PATH` | Register an ASD code-graph repo for the process pool |

### Environment

| Var | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| `CTX_SERVER` | Hub URL the `ctx` CLI targets (default `http://localhost:3001`) |
| `CTX_NAMESPACE` | Project namespace for CLI/MCP scoping |
| `CTX_BRANCH` | Default memory branch/ref |
| `CTX_TOKEN` | Bearer token the `ctx` CLI sends (for a remote authed hub) |
| `CTXONE_AUTH_TOKEN` | Same as `--auth-token` (bearer guarding REST + `/mcp`) |
| `CTXONE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma/space-separated extra allowed browser origins |
| `CTXONE_BACKUP_KEEP` | Startup snapshots to retain (default 5) |
| `CTXONE_BACKUP_INTERVAL_SECS` | Background VACUUM-INTO snapshot interval (default 1800; 0 disables) |
| `RUST_LOG` | Log level (`info` default) |

## Authentication

The hub binds `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces). With no token set, REST and `/mcp` are
reachable from the network **unauthenticated** — the hub logs a loud warning at
startup. Before exposing it beyond localhost, set a bearer token:

```bash
ctxone-hub --http --lens --path ~/.ctxone/memory.db --auth-token "$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
# or: CTXONE_AUTH_TOKEN=… ctxone-hub --http …
```

Behaviour:
- **Loopback peers (127.0.0.1/::1) are always exempt** — local CLI, Lens, and
  same-host agents keep working with no token.
- **Non-loopback requests must send** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (else 401).
- Setting a token also relaxes `/mcp`'s loopback-only Host check so authenticated
  remote clients can connect (the bearer becomes the gate).

How each client gets the token:
- **`ctx` CLI** — pass `--token <TOK>` or set `CTX_TOKEN` (only for a remote hub).
- **AI tools** — `ctx init --transport http` writes it into each tool's config:
- **`ctx init --transport http --auth-token <TOK>`** — embeds a literal bearer:
  a `headers` entry for native http (Claude Code/Cursor/VS Code) and a
  `--header` arg for the mcp-remote bridge (Claude Desktop). The token is written
  in plaintext into those config files (a warning is printed).
- **`ctx init --transport http --auth-token-env <VAR>`** — keeps the secret out
  of config files: Codex gets `bearer_token_env_var = "<VAR>"`, and native http
  entries reference `Bearer ${VAR}` (for clients that expand env vars). The
  mcp-remote bridge can't expand env vars, so Claude Desktop needs the literal
  `--auth-token` form.

### Cross-origin (CSRF / DNS-rebinding)

Independent of the token, the hub rejects **browser** requests whose `Origin`
isn't same-origin or allow-listed — so a page you visit can't drive the loopback
hub (loopback peers are auth-exempt, which is why this guard matters). CLI and
native MCP clients send no `Origin` and are unaffected; Lens is same-origin and
always allowed. CORS reflects only same-origin/allow-listed origins (never `*`).

To let a real cross-origin browser app (e.g. Lens hosted elsewhere) use the API:

```bash
ctxone-hub --http --allowed-origin https://lens.example.com   # repeatable
# or CTXONE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://a.example, https://b.example"
```

### Lens over an authenticated hub — use a tunnel

Lens is a browser SPA; it can't attach an `Authorization: Bearer` header to its
requests. So when a token is set, a **remote** browser hitting Lens directly is
rejected by the auth layer (loopback is exempt, remote is not). Treat Lens as a
**local admin UI** and reach it remotely over an SSH tunnel, which makes your
browser a loopback client of the hub:

```bash
ssh -L 3001:localhost:3001 you@hub-host      # then open http://localhost:3001
```

The hub prints this reminder at startup when `--lens` and `--auth-token` are both
set. (REST and `/mcp` remain directly reachable with the bearer token; only the
browser UI needs the tunnel.)

## Running as a service

To make the HTTP/Lens hub survive reboots and start **before** any agent (so it,
not an agent's stdio child, owns the db), run it as a login service. `ctx service`
generates and registers the unit for you — launchd on macOS, a systemd **user**
unit on Linux, and a **Task Scheduler** logon task on Windows (via `schtasks`):

```bash
ctx service install                       # lens on, port 3001, canonical db
ctx service install --port 3001 --path ~/.ctxone/memory.db
ctx service install --auth-token "$(openssl rand -hex 32)"   # embeds token (chmod 600)
ctx service install --dry-run             # print the unit + commands, write nothing
ctx service status                        # is it registered/running?
ctx service uninstall                     # stop + remove
```

The unit runs `ctxone-hub --http --lens --path <db> --port <port>` with
`RunAtLoad`/`KeepAlive` (macOS), `Restart=on-failure` (systemd), or a
`LogonTrigger` + `RestartOnFailure` (Windows), logging to `~/.ctxone/hub.log`.
Preview it first with `--dry-run`. If another hub already holds the db (an
agent's stdio hub, or a manual one), the service will fail on the lockfile —
stop it first. On Windows the auth token can't be embedded in the task; set it
with `setx CTXONE_AUTH_TOKEN <token>` instead.

## Troubleshooting

- **`database is already locked …`** — another hub owns that db. Find it
  (`ps aux | grep ctxone-hub`), or use a different `--path`/`--port`. Stale locks
  (owner gone) are reclaimed automatically.
- **Lens shows nothing / CLI can't connect** — check `CTX_SERVER` and that a hub
  is running with `--http`. `curl http://localhost:3001/api/health`.
- **Agent and Lens show different memory** — they're on different db paths
  (topology C). That's isolation working as configured.
